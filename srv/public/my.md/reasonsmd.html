<h2>A File System as Interface to Internet</h2>
<p>This might be stupid.</p>
<p>I am trying to set up a file system, I want to use it as interface between
myself and the modern web.  </p>
<p>Web UI was not ergonomically designed.  Long time using of web UI make
shoulder and back pains, it can demage muscles, bones and nerves, during the
numerous small and tedious movements among mouse, keyboard and touch screen.
But we can not blame those smart guys who invented web. When they did it, they
couldn't focus on saving our shoulders.</p>
<p>Now, if we want to save ourselves from physical fatigues, we need to interface
ourself better, we need less keyboard strokes, less mouse grabs and less
screen holding.  But when using Web UI, it's not even possible, users are
forced to switch between columns of form inputs. Such frequent small movements
get us shoulder fatigues and back pains.</p>
<p>And, if we want be creative, if we want to face up current trends in
technologies, we need to work with files.  After the boom of information and
communication technologies, if we look to a continuous history from period of
industrialisation, we know that only file can be interface between people, if
they want to share knowledge and activities among relative diversity topics,
or have to dig into deeper expertisies now and then.  File would be better
interface for us.</p>
<p><img src="/gglocal/old-net.jpg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>When ergonomic are concerned, it's not only how to position our body, but also
how to efficiently deal with jobs.  If keep in long time, even the best
position can break human body easily.  So, the first thing need to focus on is
killing job fastly.  Then good softwares can help, they can be efficient.  One
example is Vi, a software for text editing, its improved version is called
Vim.  Vim uses less key strokes to finish job, so it makes editing more
efficient.  And there are more brilliant examples as good as Vi/Vim, or even
better.  Most of them work with files,  so it would be nice if a file system
placed between me and the web.</p>

<p><img src="/gglocal/computer-position-s.png" width="60%" /></p>
<p>Nearly all computer operating system can have file systems, Unix has it, Linux
has it.  The idea of using files is simple and it's beautiful.  Programmers
tend to believe
every thing can be file.  A printing job of a printer can be a file,  a
phone call be a file, even video chat can be implemented by files.  File can
be used as modeling interfaces to make things easier to build.  Files can be
organized into folders.</p>
<p>In same time,  we also get the feeling that the web is hiding the files away
from it's users.  In many cases, the website's interface make data go through
rigid web forms, or as database records.  It's obvious the commercial website
builders tend to hide data away.  Not only because hiding data can lock user
deeper, but also because it's easier to build up their systems.  But by doing
so, they are pushing us away from the beautiful engineering designs, the
simple and powerful file systems and all of the smart tools made by genius.
It's also one of the reasons I want a file system get back between myself and
the commercial web UI.</p>
<p>Another adventage to use a file systems in between is when network becomes
unreliable, files can be backup of data, so it's possible to keep working.
Web connection can be messed up for many reasons, one of them is "man in
middle".  There are always such kind of bad men blocking in the middle,  then
files could serve as cache to relief things.</p>
<p>File could be better interface to support sharing.  For more creative jobs we
need more specific file types, and we need to share them.  Who can deny it?
So let keep working with file system, put it as our interface to the world,
connect it to every one.  Can we?</p>
<p>File should be able to get a price tag, like all the other commodities in market.
One work on his file should not be prevented to claim value for it.
Yes, file can be copied easily, it's good for sharing.
Can we think file is not good for value keeping?<br>
Thus some people think it valueless,
inspite of it can serve as natural unit to do job splitting.<br>
But value is one of the mysterious things no one can truelly understand in our
mortal world.
Further more, when we work with file,
the value might represent the abilities of it's owner to create the file.
Then the many copies improve the value.
So, we can add the extra attribute of value to file,
or we can't stop people to value their file who paid hard working on it.</p>

<p>To put a file system as interface to the web,
this is one of my stupid attempts.
I reviewed the idea many times to stop me from doing the stupid thing,
but I am a stupid who's always trying stupid things.
Now let's stop reasoning, and start
to get a list of what should such system do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It should be able to use wonderful tools from the world of <code>Bash</code>,
  <code>Perl</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>Ruby</code> and those from Unix/Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should support valueing. 
  When people work on file, they should know the value, just as
  when we bake breads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should support sharing and teaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should support styling. File and folder should be able to get different
  presentations, same as we can have many clothes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And more...</p>
</li>
</ul>
